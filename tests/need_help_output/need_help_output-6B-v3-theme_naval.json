Apparently he specializes in unusual cases. I'm not sure if my situation is unusual or not, and I'm not sure how to determine that, so I emailed him anyway.\nDr. Szozas was so nice, and he sounded so smart when he responded. He recommended at least an initial consultation. An appointment was made for Monday at 9am.\nI'm nervous when I come up to his office; the entrance is a solid wooden door, and I reach out to knock. Rap rap rap. His voice comes, well-modulated and educated, \"Come on in!\"\nI step into his office, and my eyes cast about; the lights are set to a soothing dim level, his walls are filled with books. I am tempted to read the titles, but I mustn't be rude, oh no. So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him. He wears a comfortable looking cardigan, and he has a pair of slacks, ending in some loafers. Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

It's like being lost in a dark forest, where there are all sorts of sounds and smells, but nothing is clear or distinct. All I have are questions. What if he thinks I'm crazy? Or worse, what if he doesn't think I'm crazy, but just wants to help? I feel overwhelmed by the thought of telling him anything about myself.\nThen I hear something: a whisper. A soft voice, almost too low to be heard, whispers into my ear, \"You need to trust me.\" The voice is gentle, but firm. \"Trust me, and let go of your fear.\"\nI turn my head slowly towards the source of the voice, and find myself staring into those beautiful brown eyes that seem to peer right through me. The intensity of their gaze makes my heart skip a beat, and I realize that I am completely captivated by his stare. My mouth goes dry, and I can't move or speak, but I'm not sure whether I should.\nThe man leans forward, his face inches from mine, and he speaks, \"Let me show you, Annabelle. I promise you will be okay.\"\nHe leans closer still, until our foreheads touch, and I gasp. His lips are soft, warm, and they brush against my cheek softly. I'm paralyzed with shock; I've never been kissed before!\nDr. Szozas pulls away, his breath tickling my neck. I'm dazed; I didn't expect that kiss to be quite so passionate or intimate.
