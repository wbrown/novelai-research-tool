Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it. One could fall in love with someone like him so quickly, with his apparent sincerity and kindness.\n\"Please, take a seat on the couch, make yourself comfortable.  State for the record your full name, and why you're here,\" he suggests, and he ambles over to sit in a comfortable armchair.

You seem to be dealing with quite a lot right now.

I mention growing up in rural Ohio, living with my parents and older sister until I went away to college. After graduation, I moved back home and got married, but I divorced after two years. Now I live alone. I don't date much, and I don't do drugs or drink too heavily. I work part time at the local library, helping kids find books they might enjoy.\nAs I'm describing these mundane details, I realize that I'm not being completely honest with Dr. Szozas about my life.

So I look at the man that is sitting behind his desk.\nThe first thing that strikes me is Dr. Szozas' warm, radiant grin -- with dimples! -- that told me that everything was going to be OK. Then these kind hazel eyes twinkling at me from behind a pair of wire-frame glasses. He rises up, and whoa, he's a tall man with a slender lanky frame that causes me to look up a bit at him.

Dr. Szozas walks towards me, and takes my hand in his -- I immediately notice how large and warm his hand is, his skin soft as it wraps around my fingers, \"I'm glad to see you,\" he says, and he seems to mean it.

But more than that, I feel like something happened to me while we were having sex. Like I just sort of snapped back to reality afterwards, and I don't know what happened. All I can say is that I felt very strange afterward.\" I tell him this all without stopping to breathe.\nDr. Szozas listens intently to my story, and he lets me talk through it until I've finished. \"You said you had sex with her? How many times exactly?\" he inquires.\n\"Twice. Once before the night club, and once right afterwards. The second time was even worse than the first one because she wanted me to keep doing things to her. She kept asking if I would fuck her harder, or do other stuff to her. I tried to stop her, but I couldn't help it. My body wouldn't listen to me anymore.\" I recount my experience with the blonde girl, the way that I let go of the leash I held onto earlier, the way that I just gave into the animalistic urges that I'd been trying to suppress.\nAfter I finish talking, Dr. Szozas sits there silently for a long moment, his face devoid of emotion. He looks at me with his head cocked to the side, his mouth slightly open, \"Tasha, I'm going to ask you to please stand up now,\" he instructs me.\nI rise up from the couch, and I move towards the door. \"I'm sorry, but I need to leave.
